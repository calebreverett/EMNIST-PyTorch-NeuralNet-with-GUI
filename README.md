# EMNIST-PyTorch-NeuralNet-with-GUI
A GUI where you can write a letter and the neural net will identify it, made using pytorch

NOTE: Pytorch must be installed in the venv if downloaded, it was too big to upload with the venv for GitHUB
NOTE: All commits and pushes were lost on an accidental reset, only the final push remains
